# Welcome to Resy FE Interview Exercise

## This is a hands-on test
Provided here is a skeleton application. You'll find an index.html, app.js, and app.css.
The task is to look at the provided .mov and build what is represented therein.

- The header will contain the resy logo and the text 'Select a Breed'
- Build a JavaScript application that populates a select box using this url: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all
- You can leave out subbreeds
- The select box has the initial prompt: 'Select a breed'
- When the user selects an item from the list eg 'boxer', then an image of a boxer appears below the select control. You can use this URL: https://dog.ceo/api/breed/{breed}/images/random to retrieve an image showing an example of that breed.
- Below the image there is a button. The button has the text "I don't like this one. Show me another." When the user clicks on this button a new call is made to retrieve a new image of a dog of that breed.


This task utilizes these open source urls:
- [https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all)
- [https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random)
- [https://dog.ceo/api/breed/affenpinscher/images/random](https://dog.ceo/api/breed/affenpinscher/images/random)

You will utilize these urls to create a select control in which the user can choose a breed and a random image of a dog representing that breed will be displayed on the screen.
If the user clicks a button - "I don't like that one. Show me another."" - then a new image will be presented.

Some of the things evaluated in this exercise are:
- Retrieving data and translating that to the UI controls
- Writing HTML using JavaScript
- Writing functions, keeping track of variables
- Basic styling of the page

You can use any resources available on the web.
